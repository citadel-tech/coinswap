# Taker Tutorial

The taker is the party that initiates the coinswap. It queries the directory server for a list of makers, requests offers from them and selects suitable makers for the swap. It then conducts the swap with the selected makers.

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up and running the taker, and conducting a coinswap.

## Setup


## Taker CLI

The taker CLI is an application that allows you to perform coinswaps as a taker.

### Start Bitcoin Core (Pre-requisite)

`Taker` requires a **Bitcoin Core** RPC connection running on **testnet4** for its operation. To get started, you need to start `bitcoind`:

> **Important:**  
> All apps are designed to run on **testnet4** for testing purposes. The DNS server that Taker connects to will also be on testnet4. While you can run these apps on other networks, there won't be any DNS available, so Taker won’t be able to connect to the DNS server fir getting maker's offers and can't do coinswap with makers.

To start `bitcoind`:

```bash
$ bitcoind
```

**Note:** If you don’t have `bitcoind` installed or need help setting it up, refer to the [bitcoind demo documentation](./bitcoind.md).


### Usage

Run the `taker` command to see the list of available commands and options.

```sh
$ ./taker --help

coinswap 0.1.0
Developers at Citadel-Tech
A simple command line app to operate as coinswap client

USAGE:
    taker [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -a, --USER:PASSWORD <USER:PASSWORD>
            Bitcoin Core RPC authentication string. Ex: username:password [default: user:password]

    -d, --data-directory <DATA_DIRECTORY>
            Optional data directory. Default value : "~/.coinswap/taker"

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -r, --ADDRESS:PORT <ADDRESS:PORT>
            Bitcoin Core RPC address:port value [default: 127.0.0.1:18443]

    -v, --verbosity <VERBOSITY>
            Sets the verbosity level of debug.log file [default: info] [possible values: off, error,
            warn, info, debug, trace]

    -V, --version
            Print version information

    -w, --WALLET <WALLET>
            Sets the taker wallet's name. If the wallet file already exists, it will load that
            wallet. Default: taker-wallet

SUBCOMMANDS:
    do-coinswap             Initiate the coinswap process
    fetch-offers            Update the offerbook with current market offers and display them
    get-balance             Get the total spendable wallet balance (sats)
    get-balance-contract    Get the total amount stuck in HTLC contracts (sats)
    get-balance-swap        Get the total balance received from swaps (sats)
    get-new-address         Returns a new address
    help                    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    list-utxo               Lists all currently spendable utxos
    list-utxo-contract      Lists all HTLC utxos (if any)
    list-utxo-swap          Lists all utxos received in incoming swaps
    send-to-address         Send to an external wallet address
```

In order to do a coinswap, we first need to get some coins in our wallet. Let's generate a new address and send some coins to it.

```sh
$ taker -r 127.0.0.1:38332 -a user:pass get-new-address

bcrt1qyywgd4we5y7u05lnrgs8runc3j7sspwqhekrdd
```

Now we can use a testnet4 faucet to send some coins to this address. You can find a testnet4 faucet [here](https://mempool.space/testnet4/faucet).

Once you have some coins in your wallet, you can check your balance by running the following command:

```sh
$ taker -r 127.0.0.1:38332 -a user:pass get-balance

10000000 SAT
```

Now we are ready to initate a coinswap. We are first going to sync the offer book to get a list of available makers.

```sh
$ taker -r 127.0.0.1:38332 -a user:pass fetch-offers
```

This will fetch the list of available makers from the directory server. Now we can initiate a coinswap with the makers.

```sh
$ taker -r 127.0.0.1:38332 -a user:pass coinswap
```

This will initiate a coinswap with the default parameters. This will take some time. You can check swap progress at the log file in data diectory. In an new terminal do `tail -f <datadir>/debug.log`.

## Data, Config and Wallets

The taker stores all its data in a data directory. By default, the data directory is located at `$HOME/.coinswap/taker`. You can change the data directory by passing the `--data-directory` option to the `taker` command.

The data directory contains the following files:

1. `config.toml` - The configuration file for the taker.
2. `debug.log` - The log file for the taker.
3. `wallets` directory - Contains the wallet files for the taker.

### Configuration

The configuration is stored in the `config.toml` file. You can edit this file to change the configuration of the taker. The configuration file contains the following fields:

1. `port` - The port via which the Taker listens and serves requests.
2. `socks_port` - The port via which the Taker listens and serves requests for the Socks5 proxy.
3. `rpc_port` - The port which serves the RPC server.
4. `directory_server_address` - The address of the directory server.
5. `connection_type` - The connection type to use for the directory server. Possible values are `CLEARNET` and `TOR`.

### Wallets

The taker uses wallet files to store the wallet data. The wallet files are stored in the `wallets` directory. These wallet files should be safely backed up as they contain the private keys to the wallet.
