# Maker-cli Tutorial

`maker-cli` is a straightforward command-line tool designed as an RPC client for `makerd`. It allows you to connect to the server, retrieve vital information, and manage various server operations efficiently.

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through how to use `maker-cli` to get the most out of your `makerd` setup. Let's get started!


> ### **Important Note**
> `makerd` listens to RPC requests from `maker-cli` **only** when it is fully set up. This setup includes creating a new fidelity bond (if one doesnâ€™t already exist) and completing other necessary configurations.  
> 
> If `makerd` is not fully set up, `maker-cli` commands will not function.  
> 
> ðŸ‘‰ **Before starting this tutorial**, ensure your `makerd` setup is complete.  
> If youâ€™re unsure how to set it up, check out our [Makerd Setup Guide](./makerd.md) first, and then return to this tutorial.

### Key Points About the `rpc-port` Argument
 - The `rpc-port` option specifies the RPC port that `makerd` listens on. By default, this is set to **`6103`**.

 - #### If you're using the **default configuration**:
   - You don't need to include the `rpc-port` argument.

 - #### If you're using a **custom configuration**:
   - Pass your custom port number using the `-p` or `--rpc-port` option, like this:

```bash
  $ ./maker-cli -p 6104 <SUBCOMMAND>
```

For this tutorial, weâ€™ll assume the default configuration is being used. Output examples will reflect this setup.

Here's a simplified and easier-to-read version of your content:

---

## Exploring Maker CLI Commands

### SendPing
To check if `makerd` is listening to RPC requests from `maker-cli`, use the `send-ping` command. 

Run:  
```bash
$ ./maker-cli send-ping
```

**Output:**  
```bash
success
```

This confirms that the maker server is listening and responding to requests.

---

### ShowDataDir
To get the maker server's data directory, use this command:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli show-data-dir
```

**Output:**  
```  
<home_directory>/coinswap/maker
```

This is where all the maker's data is stored.

---

### ShowTorAddress
If your maker server is running on `Tor`, find its Tor address using this command:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli show-tor-address
```

**Output:**  
```bash
<maker's tor_address>
```

This address is our maker server's identity on the Tor network.

---

### ShowFidelity
When setting up `makerd`, we fund the makerâ€™s wallet and create a fidelity bond. To see details about our existing fidelity bond, use:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli show-fidelity
```

**Output:**  
```bash
{
    0: (
        FidelityBond {
            outpoint: OutPoint {
                txid: 6c06a925066b0cf8adb400e53001b20587729407bce7dcb95dcacd038950b0e4,
                vout: 0,
            },
            amount: 50000 SAT,
            lock_time: 2465 blocks,
            pubkey: PublicKey { ... },
            conf_height: 229349,
            cert_expiry: 5,
        },
        false,
    ),
}
```

This shows our maker's fidelity bond. 

> **Note:** Currently, a maker can have only one active (unexpired) fidelity bond at a time. Once a bond expires and is redeemed, a new fidelity bond can be created.


---

### ListFidelityUTXOs
To view fidelity UTXOs in the makerâ€™s wallet, run:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-fidelity
```

**Output:**  
```json
[
    ListUnspentResultEntry {
        txid: 6c06a925066b0cf8adb400e53001b20587729407bce7dcb95dcacd038950b0e4,
        vout: 0,
        address: Some("BCRT1QKP92002..."),
        amount: 50000 SAT,
        confirmations: 1,
        spendable: true,
    },
]
```

Since only one live fidelity bond is allowed at a time, this shows a single UTXO of `50,000 sats`.

---

### CheckFidelityBalance
To check the balance of our fidelity UTXOs, use:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli get-balance-fidelity
```

**Output:**  
```bash
50000 sats
```

This confirms the balance of our fidelity UTXOs matches the amount we set when creating the bond.

---

For more details about fidelity bonds, refer to the [Fidelity Bond Documentation](https://github.com/citadel-tech/Coinswap-Protocol-Specification/blob/main/v1/4_fidelity.md).

---

Next, weâ€™ll explore other UTXOs and balances in Coinswap.


### Other utxos and thier balance:
 #### Swap utxos:

 ```bash 
 $ ./maker-cli  list-utxo-swap

 []
 ```

 Since we have not done any coinswap yet, so we have no swap utxos yet and thus we would have no swap balances as can be verified by running the command:

 ```bash
 $ ./maker-cli  get-balance-swap

 0 sats
```


#### Contract utxos:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli  list-utxo-contract

[]
```

As mentioned above -> we have not paritcipated in any coinswap till now, thus have no unsuccessfull coinswap currently -> thus we have no `contract utxos` and have no balance in this category as shown:

```bash
$  ./maker-cli  get-balance-contract
0 sats
```


>[!IMPORTANT]
> Currently `maker-cli` does not provide any method to see maker's normal wallet utxos and their correspinding balance seperately as we do have for other utxos types.
> we have to manually figure these utxos and their balances by using  `list-utxo` and `get-balance` command respectively.
> where `list-utxo` returns all the utxos present in the maker wallet including the `fidleity utxos` also.
> and `get-balance` returns the total spendable balance which includes balance of normal utxos , swap utxos, contract utxos but excludes `fidelitly utxos`.

Let's find them out: 

```bash
 $ ./maker-cli  list-utxo
  [
      ListUnspentResultEntry {
          txid: 6c06a925066b0cf8adb400e53001b20587729407bce7dcb95dcacd038950b0e4,
          vout: 0,
          address: Some(
              Address<NetworkUnchecked>(BCRT1QKP92002WJPU5WFLU0YNTU3YXRVDR52N98STWFZJ7MF3F88RJ5PLQKDEUQY),
          ),
          label: Some(
              "ae28aba4",
          ),
          redeem_script: None,
          witness_script: None,
          script_pub_key: Script(OP_0 OP_PUSHBYTES_32 b04aa7bd4e90794727fc7926be44861b1a3a2a653c16e48a5eda62939c72a07e),
          amount: 50000 SAT,
          confirmations: 1,
          spendable: true,
          solvable: false,
          descriptor: None,
          safe: true,
      },
      ListUnspentResultEntry {
          txid: 6c06a925066b0cf8adb400e53001b20587729407bce7dcb95dcacd038950b0e4,
          vout: 1,
          address: Some(
              Address<NetworkUnchecked>(BCRT1QC538UUY77TN2YLYPTLXEQ6S8GL55753UK9C909),
          ),
          label: None,
          redeem_script: None,
          witness_script: None,
          script_pub_key: Script(OP_0 OP_PUSHBYTES_20 c5227e709ef2e6a27c815fcd906a0747e94f523c),
          amount: 949000 SAT,
          confirmations: 1,
          spendable: true,
          solvable: true,
          descriptor: Some(
              "wpkh([bd63c57a/1/0]024974169b3f59a123ac00e5034edd256593204cfab5668e5751d42bc864e0e955)#ljsywwyv",
          ),
          safe: true,
      },
  ]
```  

We created a funding transaction to fund the maker wallet and establish the fidelity bonds. As a result, the command displays two UTXOs: 

1. The **fidelity UTXO** (which we've already seen).
2. The **normal funding UTXO**.

### Breakdown:
- Initially, we funded the wallet with `0.01 BTC`.
- `50,000 sats` were used for the fidelity bond.
- `1,000 sats` were used as the mining fee for the fidelity transaction.

The remaining balance after these transactions is:

**949,000 sats** = **1,000,000 sats** (total funding) - **50,000 sats** (for the fidelity bond) - **1,000 sats** (mining fees).

We can verify this balance by running the `get-balance` command, which shows the total spendable balance (excluding the fidelity bond balance):

```bash
$ ./maker-cli get-balance
949,000 sats
```

---

### Deriving an Address from the Maker's Wallet:
To derive a new external address from the maker's wallet, use the `get-new-address` command with `maker-cli`.

```bash
$ ./maker-cli get-new-address

<maker's external address>
```

### Spending `10,000 sats` from the Maker's Wallet:
Next, let's send `10,000 sats` from the maker's wallet to an external address.

#### **Step 1**: Derive an External Address Using `bitcoin-cli`'s `getnewaddress` Command

```bash
$ bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
```

#### **Step 2**: Use `maker-cli`'s `send-to-address` Command to Send the Amount to the Derived Address

The `send-to-address` command allows us to send Bitcoin to an external address. To view the available options for this command, run the `--help` option:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli send-to-address --help

Send Bitcoin to an external address and returns the txid

USAGE:
    maker-cli send-to-address --address <ADDRESS> --amount <AMOUNT> --fee <FEE>

OPTIONS:
    -a, --amount <AMOUNT>      Amount to send in sats
    -f, --fee <FEE>            Total fee to be paid in sats
    -h, --help                 Print help information
    -t, --address <ADDRESS>    Recipient's address
```


> **Note:**  
> The command currently requires the `fee` parameter to specify the total mining fee for the transaction instead of using `fee_rate`. This is because the functionality to calculate the fee using a `fee_rate` for transactions that have not been created yet has not been implemented. This process will be improved in the next release.


Let's now send `10,000 sats` to the derived address, with a mining fee of `1,000 sats`:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli send-to-address --amount 10000 --address <derived address> --fee 1000

<tx hex>
```

This command will create a transaction, send `10,000 sats` from the maker's wallet to the derived address, broadcast the transaction to the network, and return the transaction ID in hex format.

### Transaction Confirmation and Wallet Synchronization:

Once the transaction is broadcasted to the network, it will need to be confirmed. After confirmation, we have to sync our wallet to catch the latest updates:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli sync-wallet
success
```

On `makerd`, we will see:

```bash
INFO coinswap::maker::rpc::server - Starting wallet sync.
INFO coinswap::maker::rpc::server - Wallet sync success.
```

### Checking Wallet Balances and UTXOs:
Finally, we can check the wallet's updated balances and the list of UTXOs as done previously.

Here is the revised version with the requested changes:

---

### **Fidelity UTXOs**:
```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-fidelity

[
    ListUnspentResultEntry {
        txid: 6c06a925066b0cf8adb400e53001b20587729407bce7dcb95dcacd038950b0e4,
        vout: 0,
        address: Some(
            Address<NetworkUnchecked>(BCRT1QKP92002WJPU5WFLU0YNTU3YXRVDR52N98STWFZJ7MF3F88RJ5PLQKDEUQY),
        ),
        label: Some(
            "ae28aba4",
        ),
        redeem_script: None,
        witness_script: None,
        script_pub_key: Script(OP_0 OP_PUSHBYTES_32 b04aa7bd4e90794727fc7926be44861b1a3a2a653c16e48a5eda62939c72a07e),
        amount: 50000 SAT,
        confirmations: 2,
        spendable: true,
        solvable: false,
        descriptor: None,
        safe: true,
    },
]

$ ./maker-cli get-balance-fidelity

50000 sats
```  

> **NOTE**: Fidelity UTXOs are not used for spending purposes. We can only spend these UTXOs by using the `redeem_fidelity` command after the fidelity bond expires. This is why the UTXO list and balance remain unchanged.

### *Rredeem Fidelity**:
[TODO]

### **Shutting Down Maker Server**:

After performing all functionalities, we can stop the maker server using the `stop` command.

```bash
$ ./maker-cli stop

Shutdown Initiated
```

Once you run this command, the maker server initiates a shutdown, and weâ€™ll see the following logs indicating the shutdown process:

```bash
 INFO coinswap::maker::server - [6102] Maker is shutting down.
 INFO coinswap::maker::api - Joining 4 threads
 INFO coinswap::maker::api - [6102] Thread RPC Thread joined
 INFO coinswap::maker::api - [6102] Thread Contract Watcher Thread joined

 INFO coinswap::maker::server - Shutdown wallet syncing completed.
 INFO coinswap::maker::server - Wallet file saved to disk.
