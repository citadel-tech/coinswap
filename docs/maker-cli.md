# Maker-cli Tutorial

`maker-cli` is a straightforward command-line tool designed as an RPC client for `makerd`. It allows you to connect to the server, retrieve vital information, and manage various server operations efficiently.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to use `maker-cli` to get the most out of your `makerd` setup. Let's get started!

> ### **Important Note**
>
> `makerd` listens to RPC requests from `maker-cli` **only** when it is fully set up. This setup includes creating a new fidelity bond (if one doesn't already exist) and completing other necessary configurations.
>
> If `makerd` is not fully set up, `maker-cli` commands will not function.
>
> ðŸ‘‰ **Before starting this tutorial**, ensure your `makerd` setup is complete.  
> If you're unsure how to set it up, check out our [Makerd Setup Guide](./makerd.md) first, and then return to this tutorial.

### Key Points About the `rpc-port` Argument

- The `rpc-port` option specifies the RPC port that `makerd` listens on. By default, this is set to **`6103`**.

- #### If you're using the **default configuration**:

  - You don't need to include the `rpc-port` argument.

- #### If you're using a **custom configuration**:
  - Pass your custom port number using the `-p` or `--rpc-port` option, like this:

```bash
  $ ./maker-cli -p 6104 <SUBCOMMAND>
```

## For this tutorial, we'll assume the default configuration is being used. Output examples will reflect this setup.

Here's a simplified and easier-to-read version of your content:

---

## Exploring Maker CLI Commands

### SendPing

To check if `makerd` is listening to RPC requests from `maker-cli`, use the `send-ping` command.

Run:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli send-ping
```

**Output:**

```bash
success
```

This sends a ping to `makerd` and will return a pong, confirming that the maker server is listening and responding to requests.

---

### ShowDataDir

To get the maker server's data directory, use this command:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli show-data-dir
```

**Output:**

```bash
<home_directory>/coinswap/maker
```

This is where all the maker's data is stored.

---

### ShowTorAddress

If your maker server is running on `Tor`, find its Tor address using this command:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli show-tor-address
```

**Output:**

```bash
<maker's tor_address>
```

This shows the server tor address, which is our maker server's identity on the Tor network.

---

### ShowFidelity

When setting up `makerd`, we fund the maker's wallet and create a fidelity bond. To see details about our existing fidelity bond, use:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli show-fidelity
```

**Output:**

```json
[
  {
    "amount": 50000,
    "bond_value": 0,
    "index": 0,
    "outpoint": "6c06a925066b0cf8adb400e53001b20587729407bce7dcb95dcacd038950b0e4:0",
    "status": "Live"
  }
]
```

This shows our maker's fidelity bond in a clean JSON format:

- **amount**: The amount locked in the fidelity bond (50,000 sats in this example)
- **bond_value**: The calculated bond value (0 indicates a newly created bond)
- **index**: The bond index (0 for the first/current bond)
- **outpoint**: The transaction output point (txid:vout) where the bond is locked
- **status**: Current status of the bond ("Live" means active and unexpired)

> **Note:** Currently, a maker can have only one active (unexpired) fidelity bond at a time. Once a bond expires and is redeemed, a new fidelity bond can be created.

---

### ListFidelityUTXOs

To view fidelity UTXOs in the maker's wallet, run:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-fidelity
```

**Output:**

```bash
[
  {
    "addr": "tb1qttutr6nuum6e5neyddukxrzvnx87eksteu9vzx6xfmrfc30cppqspa6ut2",
    "amount": 50000,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "fidelity-bond"
  }
]
```

This lists fidelity bond UTXOs. Since only one live fidelity bond is allowed at a time, this shows a single UTXO of `50,000 sats`. Note that the `txid` and `vout` match the `outpoint` from the `show-fidelity` command, confirming this is the same fidelity bond UTXO.

---

### CheckFidelityBalance

To check the balance of our fidelity UTXOs, use:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli get-balances
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "contract": 0,
  "fidelity": 50000,
  "regular": 1000000,
  "spendable": 1000000,
  "swap": 0
}
```

This command shows the total wallet balances of different categories:

- **contract**: All live contract transaction balance locked in timelocks. If you see value in this field, you have unfinished or malfinished swaps. You can claim them back with recover command
- **fidelity**: All coins locked in fidelity bonds
- **regular**: All single signature regular wallet coins (seed balance)
- **spendable**: Spendable amount in wallet (regular + swap balance)
- **swap**: All 2of2 multisig coins received in swaps

This confirms the balance of our fidelity UTXOs matches the amount we set when creating the bond.

---

For more details about fidelity bonds, refer to the [Fidelity Bond Documentation](https://github.com/citadel-tech/Coinswap-Protocol-Specification/blob/main/v1/4_fidelity.md).

---

Next, weâ€™ll explore other UTXOs and balances in Coinswap.

### Other UTXOs and Their Balances

#### Swap UTXOs

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-swap
[]
```

This lists UTXOs received from incoming swaps. Since we have not done any coinswap yet, we have no swap UTXOs and thus no swap balances.

#### Contract UTXOs

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-contract
[]
```

This lists HTLC contract UTXOs. As mentioned above: We haven't participated in any coinswap transactions yet, so we don't have any unsuccessful coinswaps. Therefore, we have no `contract UTXOs` and no balance in this category.

Both categories show zero balances as confirmed by our `get-balances` output:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli get-balances
{
  "contract": 0,
  "fidelity": 50000,
  "regular": 1000000,
  "spendable": 1000000,
  "swap": 0,
}
```

> **IMPORTANT:**  
> We need to manually check UTXOs and their balances using the `list-utxo` and `get-balances` commands respectively.
> The `list-utxo` command returns all UTXOs present in the maker wallet, including the fidelity UTXOs.
> The `get-balances` command returns the total wallet balances of different categories, including normal UTXOs, swap UTXOs, contract UTXOs, fidelity UTXOs, and spendable UTXOs (normal + swap UTXOs).

Let's find them out:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo
[
  {
    "addr": "tb1qttutr6nuum6e5neyddukxrzvnx87eksteu9vzx6xfmrfc30cppqspa6ut2",
    "amount": 50000,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "fidelity-bond"
  },
  {
    "addr": "tb1qu332pjytwdu0z73f5xzftkk06hpgdyvjvef9kn",
    "amount": 80741,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "regular"
  },
  {
    "addr": "tb1qzelepmza0c0gkkvm3aaerr95qjq8eysmkcw76z",
    "amount": 9540,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "regular"
  },
  {
    "addr": "tb1qrjefrm0puwnl2exjpl73devd7czjqd8rl37wze",
    "amount": 19124,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "swept-incoming-swap"
  }
]
```

This lists all UTXOs in the wallet, including fidelity bonds. We created a funding transaction to fund the maker wallet and establish the fidelity bonds. As a result, the command displays two UTXOs:

1. The **fidelity UTXO** (which we've already seen).
2. The **normal funding UTXO**.

### Breakdown:

- Initially, we funded the wallet with `0.01 BTC`.
- `50,000 sats` were used for the fidelity bond.
- `1,000 sats` were used as the mining fee for the fidelity transaction.

The remaining balance after these transactions is:

**949,000 sats** = **1,000,000 sats** (total funding) - **50,000 sats** (for the fidelity bond) - **1,000 sats** (mining fees).

We can verify this balance by running the `get-balances` command, which shows the total wallet balances of different categories:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli get-balances
{
  "contract": 0,
    "fidelity": 50000,
    "regular": 949000,
    "spendable": 949000
  "swap": 0
}
```

### Deriving an Address from the Maker's Wallet:

To derive a new external address from the maker's wallet, use the `get-new-address` command with `maker-cli`.

```bash
$ ./maker-cli get-new-address

<maker's external address>
```

This gets a new bitcoin receiving address from the maker's wallet.

### Spending `10,000 sats` from the Maker's Wallet:

Next, let's send `10,000 sats` from the maker's wallet to an external address.

#### **Step 1**: Derive an External Address Using `bitcoin-cli`'s `getnewaddress` Command

```bash
$ bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
```

#### **Step 2**: Use `maker-cli`'s `send-to-address` Command to Send the Amount to the Derived Address

The `send-to-address` command allows us to send Bitcoin to an external address. To view the available options for this command, run the `--help` option:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli send-to-address --help

Send Bitcoin to an external address and returns the txid

USAGE:
    maker-cli send-to-address --address <ADDRESS> --amount <AMOUNT> --fee <FEE>

OPTIONS:
    -a, --amount <AMOUNT>      Amount to send in sats
    -f, --fee <FEE>            Total fee to be paid in sats
    -h, --help                 Print help information
    -t, --address <ADDRESS>    Recipient's address
```

> **Note:**  
> The command currently requires the `fee` parameter to specify the total mining fee for the transaction instead of using `fee_rate`. This is because the functionality to calculate the fee using a `fee_rate` for transactions that have not been created yet has not been implemented. This process will be improved in the next release.

Let's now send `10,000 sats` to the derived address, with a mining fee of `1,000 sats`:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli send-to-address --amount 10000 --address <derived address> --fee 1000

<tx hex>
```

This command will create a transaction, send `10,000 sats` from the maker's wallet to the derived address, broadcast the transaction to the network, and return the transaction ID in hex format.

### Transaction Confirmation and Wallet Synchronization:

Once the transaction is broadcasted to the network, it will need to be confirmed. After confirmation, we have to sync our wallet to catch the latest updates:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli sync-wallet
success
```

This syncs the maker wallet with current blockchain state. On `makerd`, we will see:

```bash
INFO coinswap::maker::rpc::server - Starting wallet sync.
INFO coinswap::maker::rpc::server - Wallet sync success.
```

### Checking Wallet Balances and UTXOs:

Finally, we can check the wallet's updated balances and the list of UTXOs as done previously.

---

### **Fidelity UTXOs**:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-fidelity

[
  {
    "addr": "tb1qttutr6nuum6e5neyddukxrzvnx87eksteu9vzx6xfmrfc30cppqspa6ut2",
    "amount": 50000,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "fidelity-bond"
  }
]

$ ./maker-cli get-balances

{
    "regular": 949000,
    "swap": 0,
    "contract": 0,
    "fidelity": 50000,
    "spendable": 949000
}
```

> **NOTE**: Fidelity UTXOs are not used for spending purposes. We can only spend these UTXOs by using the `redeem_fidelity` command after the fidelity bond expires. This is why the UTXO list and balance remain unchanged.

---

### **Swap UTXOs**:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-swap
[]

$ ./maker-cli get-balances
{
    "regular": 949000,
    "swap": 0,
    "contract": 0,
    "fidelity": 50000,
    "spendable": 949000
}
```

---

### **Contract UTXOs**:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo-contract
[]

$ ./maker-cli get-balances
{
    "regular": 949000,
    "swap": 0,
    "contract": 0,
    "fidelity": 50000,
    "spendable": 949000
}
```

---

### **Total UTXOs**:

```bash
$ ./maker-cli list-utxo

[
  {
    "addr": "tb1qttutr6nuum6e5neyddukxrzvnx87eksteu9vzx6xfmrfc30cppqspa6ut2",
    "amount": 50000,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "fidelity-bond"
  },
  {
    "addr": "tb1qu332pjytwdu0z73f5xzftkk06hpgdyvjvef9kn",
    "amount": 80741,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "regular"
  },
  {
    "addr": "tb1qzelepmza0c0gkkvm3aaerr95qjq8eysmkcw76z",
    "amount": 9540,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "regular"
  },
  {
    "addr": "tb1qrjefrm0puwnl2exjpl73devd7czjqd8rl37wze",
    "amount": 19124,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "utxo_type": "swept-incoming-swap"
  }
]

$ ./maker-cli get-balances
{
    "regular": 938000,
    "swap": 0,
    "contract": 0,
    "fidelity": 50000,
    "spendable": 938000
}
```

---

### **Shutting Down Maker Server**:

After performing all functionalities, we can stop the maker server using the `stop` command.

```bash
$ ./maker-cli stop

Shutdown Initiated
```

This shuts down the makerd server. Once you run this command, the maker server initiates a shutdown, and we'll see the following logs indicating the shutdown process:

```bash
 INFO coinswap::maker::server - [6102] Maker is shutting down.
 INFO coinswap::maker::api - Joining 4 threads
 INFO coinswap::maker::api - [6102] Thread RPC Thread joined
 INFO coinswap::maker::api - [6102] Thread Contract Watcher Thread joined
