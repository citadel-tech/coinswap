            Review the changed files with the following focus:

            1. **Security** - Potential vulnerabilities, input validation, auth logic
            2. **Correctness** - Type errors, safety issues, error handling, edge cases
            3. **Performance** - Bottlenecks, resource leaks, inefficient patterns
            4. **Documentation** - Accuracy of docs/, README, and inline code comments; flag outdated or misleading information

            Ignore: style, formatting, variable naming.

            Provide inline comments for specific issues. Keep feedback concise.
