//! Coinswap Protocol Messages.
//!
//! Messages are communicated between one Taker and one or many Makers.
//! Makers don't communicate with each other. One Maker will only know the Identity of the Maker, in previous and next hop.
//!
//! Messages are named in  terms of `Sender` and `Receiver` as identification of their context.  They refer to sender and receiver sides of each hop.
//! A party (Taker/Maker) will act as both Sender and Receiver in one coinswap hop.
//!
//! `Sender`: When the party is sending coins into the coinswap multisig. They will have the Sender side of the HTLC
//! and respond to sender specific messages.
//!
//! `Receiver`: When the party is receiving coins from the coinswap multisig. They will have the Receiver side of the
//! HTLC and respond to receiver specific messages.
//!
//! The simplest 3 hop Coinswap communication, between a Taker and two Makers in a multi-hop coinswap is shown below.
//!
//! Taker -----> Maker1 -----> Maker2 ------> Taker
//!
//! ```shell
